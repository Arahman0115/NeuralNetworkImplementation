# NeuralNetworkImplementation
This project presents the implementation and evaluation of a deep neural network using TensorFlow to predict manufacturing defect rates from process parameters. The model was developed through systematic experimentation across multiple network architectures, optimization algorithms, learning rates, and batch sizes, resulting in over 50 trained model variants. Performance was rigorously assessed using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), with the best-performing configuration achieving an MSE of 0.00027 on held-out test data.

To ensure robustness and generalizability, the training pipeline incorporated train–validation–test splits and cross-validation strategies to mitigate overfitting. Comparative analysis of optimization methods, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam, was conducted to evaluate convergence behavior, training stability, and computational efficiency. The results highlight the impact of hyperparameter selection and optimizer choice on model performance, providing a reproducible framework for defect prediction in manufacturing systems.
